# LEEF Trader Signer — Architecture

> The machine that creates **your** API proxy — not a hosted proxy everyone shares.

Bring your own Cloudflare account. Bring your own API keys. Deploy your own edge
gateway. The platform never routes production traffic and never becomes a
centralized API-key vault.

This project is a fork of [0xSigner](https://github.com/NostrDanish/0xsigner), tuned
for [LEEF Trader](https://github.com/NostrDanish/leef-trader): it ships a preloaded
preset that deploys the **LEEF Trader AI analysis gateway** (OpenAI-compatible →
PayPerQ, server-side system prompt, ZDR routing, 10s timeout, 20 req/min). The
generic machinery (provider adapters, templates, CORS lockdown, secret injection)
is fully preserved, so additional providers and keys can be added to the same
worker later.

                                   Provider APIs (Brave, OpenAI,
                                   indexer, crawler, Tor gateway, …)
```

Two kinds of values, kept strictly separate:

| Value | Where it lives | Ever in code/Git/browser-bundle? |
|-------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| **Manifest** (routes, endpoints, model, CORS, limits, system prompt) | Serialized into the Worker as a JSON literal | Yes — it's non-secret by construction |
| **Secrets** (provider keys, gateway key) | Cloudflare Worker **secret store** (`env.*`) | **Never** |

The deployer sends secrets straight from the browser to Cloudflare's
`PUT /accounts/{id}/workers/scripts/{name}/secrets` endpoint. The token used for
deployment is held only in React state for the lifetime of the tab.

## Source layout

```
src/lib/signer/
├── manifest.ts            # zod schema for the non-secret manifest; requiredSecrets(); plainTextVars()
├── templates.ts           # preset manifests per template + the LEEF Trader preset
├── cloudflare.ts          # browser-side Cloudflare REST client (verify/upload/secrets/subdomain/health)
├── useWizard.ts           # wizard state (token + secrets live only here, in memory)
└── runtime/
    ├── core.js            # CORS, SSRF guard, error model, rate limiter, public auth
    ├── providers.js       # one adapter per ProviderType (handle + healthCheck)
    ├── entry.js           # the Worker's default-export fetch handler
    └── generator.ts       # assembles core+providers+entry+manifest into ONE module
```

The `runtime/*` files are written to be **bundle-safe**: their only cross-file
references are exported symbols, so `generator.ts` strips `import`/`export`
syntax and concatenates them into a single self-contained Worker module,
injecting the manifest as a literal. They are authored as **plain JavaScript**
(not TypeScript) because the Cloudflare script-upload API does not transpile
TypeScript — the generated worker must be valid ECMAScript byte-for-byte, and
the file you read in the repo is exactly what runs at the edge. The Worker is
uploaded module-syntax via `multipart/form-data` (`main_module`).

Non-secret operator tunables that should be changeable without a redeploy (e.g.
`PPQ_MODEL` for the AI provider's model + routing suffix) are uploaded as
`plain_text` Worker **bindings** next to the module; the runtime reads
`env.<MODEL_VAR>` first and falls back to the manifest model.

---

## Provider adapters

Each adapter implements a uniform shape:

```ts
validateConfig / validateCredentials / buildRequest / parseResponse / healthCheck
```

(concretely: a `handle(ctx, cfg)` dispatcher + `healthCheckProvider(...)`).

| Type | What it fronts | Secret |
|------|----------------|--------|
| `brave` | Brave Search | `BRAVE_API_KEY` |
| `openai` | any OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `generic-rest` | any fixed REST endpoint | configured |
| `ip-geo` | ipinfo / IP2Location / MaxMind-style | `IPGEO_API_KEY` |
| `indexer` | SIP-01 / Dsearch-style indexer | `INDEXER_API_KEY` |
| `crawler` | Crawlstr-style crawler (SSRF-hardened) | `CRAWLER_API_KEY` |
| `tor-gateway` | an authenticated Tor gateway node | `TOR_GATEWAY_TOKEN` |

Three access levels (per the design's "really important part"):

1. **HTTP API** — Brave, OpenAI, IP/GEO, indexer, crawler → Worker → HTTPS API.
2. **Nostr/indexer protocol** — SIP-01, NIP-50/77/98-shaped queries → Worker → indexer.
3. **Network gateway** — Tor → Worker → *authenticated HTTPS Tor gateway* → SOCKS/Tor.
   A Cloudflare Worker cannot be a Tor SOCKS client, so Tor is a dedicated node
   the Worker talks to over a hardened, authenticated HTTPS API. The raw SOCKS
   port is never exposed.

---

## Security invariants

- **No open proxy.** Upstream endpoints are fixed at deploy time. There is no
  `?url=anything`. Only the crawler/Tor adapters accept a target URL, and both
  run it through the SSRF guard.
- **SSRF guard** blocks localhost, `127/8`, `10/8`, `172.16/12`, `192.168/16`,
  `169.254/16`, `100.64/10`, IPv6 loopback/ULA/link-local, and cloud-metadata
  hostnames — unless the deployment explicitly enables `internalMode`.
- **Secrets never leak.** They are read only via `env.*`; status/health responses
  are built to contain no secret material; provider error bodies are drained and
  replaced with sanitized messages.
- **CORS** reflects allowlisted origins only — never `*` unless public mode is
  explicitly chosen.
- **Server-controlled AI.** The operator's model and system prompt are forced;
  clients can only pick a model from an explicit allowlist and can never inject
  a system prompt.
- **Rate limiting** returns `429` + `Retry-After`, keyed by IP / API key /
  header / Nostr pubkey, per-route. (V1 uses a best-effort per-isolate limiter;
  the documented upgrade path is a Cloudflare Rate Limiting binding.)
- **Least privilege.** The wizard asks for an API **Token** (not the global key)
  scoped to `Workers Scripts:Edit`.

---

## Built-in endpoints on every deployed worker

- `GET /api/status` — non-secret status (which providers are configured).
- `GET /api/health` — per-provider reachability probe.
- plus whatever routes the manifest defines (e.g. `/api/search`, `/api/ai`).

---

## Phased roadmap

- **Phase 1 (this repo):** generic runtime, Cloudflare deploy, secrets, CORS,
  rate limiting, generic-rest, Brave, OpenAI. — **LEEF Trader is the first consumer**
  (AI analysis gateway preset: PayPerQ + ZDR + server-side prompt).
- **Phase 2:** IP/GEO, indexer, crawler, Nostr (NIP-50/77/98 binding with
  canonical public-origin handling).
- **Phase 3:** Tor gateway node reference implementation, game API, Durable
  Objects for quotas/jobs, CF Rate Limiting binding, custom domains, service
  bindings.
